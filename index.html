    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>I do not have any work experience in the computer science field, as I am still a student and most of my work experience has been pushing carts for Target or working in a warehouse for Amazon; and I am currently employed by UPS at their shipping warehouse in Orem Utah. Working early morning hours doing physically and mentally intensive activities has taught me the value of hard work, perseverence, and patience.</p>
